# Hydropathicity Calculation using Kyte–Doolittle Scale

This repository contains an R script for computing the hydropathicity profile of protein sequences based on the Kyte–Doolittle scale.  
The script allows users to calculate amino-acid hydrophobicity values, apply sliding window smoothing, and visualize hydropathicity patterns across a protein sequence.

## Background
Protein hydrophobicity is an important property related to protein structure, membrane-spanning regions, and functional domains.  
The Kyte–Doolittle method is one of the most widely used techniques to assess the hydropathicity of protein sequences.
